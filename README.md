# Driver-Monitor
Problem statement:
Falling asleep while driving accounts for a considerable proportion of vehicle accidents under monotonous driving conditions. Many of these accidents are related to work for example, drivers of lorries, goods vehicles, and company cars. Time of day (circadian) effects are profound, with sleepiness being particularly evident during night shift work, and driving home afterwards. Circadian factors are as important in determining driver sleepiness as is the duration of the drive, but only duration of the drive is built into legislation protecting professional drivers. Older drivers are also vulnerable to sleepiness in the mid-afternoon. You are required to create an android app which will produce a sound if the app founds that driver is sleepy or sleep deprived according to the frequency of yawning or blinking of driver. The app should also send an emergency SOS to the numbers provided by driver informing about the condition of data. The app should support an external web cam using which it can monitor the driver.
